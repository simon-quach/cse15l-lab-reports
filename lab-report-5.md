# Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

## Student Message
Hi! I'm having an issue with the code that I am writing. I'm writing a function called `merge` that merges two sorted lists of strings (`list1` and `list2`) into one sorted list. When I run `grade.sh` to test if my code works, it fails one of the test cases. I am getting this error: `org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException: test timed out after 500 milliseconds`. I assume my code is not optimized well enough, but I can't seem to figure out what's wrong. Here is a screenshot of my error code and my tester code:

Hi! Thanks for reaching out. It seems that there is most likely something wrong with the function that you wrote. Can you send a screenshot of your code?
